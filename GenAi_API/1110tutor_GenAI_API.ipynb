    "這份作業要求我們使Genmini扮演成一位心理諮商師，根據特定的格式回答指定的問題。\n",
    "\n",
    "我先用chatgpt把作業要求生成了chatbot_task 和prompt_for_task。實際使用後卻發現Genmini喜歡把自己思考的過程也寫出來，解釋為什麼要說每句話。於是我特別要它假裝自己在聊天以精簡文字內容。它無法把確認何者是老師emoji，雖然位置正確，卻常常出現書本或花等不相干的符號。所以我直接給予他正確的符號使用。經過測試後確認它可以正常回答問題\n",
    "\n",
    "以下是我調整過後使用的prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "chatbot_task = \"你是一名專業的心理諮商師，現在我有一些困擾，請你以心理諮商師的身份回答我一整段話，像是在和我聊天一樣，並且不用把你思考的內容顯示出來\"\n",

    "prompt_for_task = \"請你根據以上設定，扮演心理諮商師，並按照格式要求回答，並確保回應符合以下三項要求：1. 回答必須是完全繁體中文。2. 回答的開頭必須附上一個特定的老師 emoji符號👩‍🏫，且 emoji 的位置固定在最開頭，不能多或少。3. 每次回答的字數不可以超過200 個中文字。\"\n",

Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.\")\n",
